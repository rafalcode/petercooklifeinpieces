# Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling in the 12 days of Christmas

<i><b>"Christmas, it used to be great fun in the old days, when it was simply an orgy of commercial excess, but now I find people are tainting the whole thing with a lot of religious mumbo jumbo."</b></i>

This is a set of transcripts of the twelve 5 minute programmes, produced by Talkback and broadcast by the BBC during the Christmas period of 1990.

These are available on various YouTube accounts, some of which have been published there for a very long time, for example [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5918027E140EF1F7). Below you will find transcripts of individual episodes together with a link to the video.

Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling is a persona of Peter Cook, widely recognised as one the great comedic geniuses of the United Kingdom. Peter invented him while he was quite young, and from that period there is a famous sketch of a young Sir Arthur talking about his vain efforts teaching crows to swim underwater. Trying to get animals to do things they're entirely unsuited for is a common trope of Sir Arthur's, and come up here in various guises.

Besides unconstrained hilarity, there is also something special about the elder Sir Arthur, a poignancy regarding the futility of his lifetime's activities which is also a send-up of other's lives that ressemble his. He is in fact interviewed by none other than Ludovic Kennedy, who did as much as he could do: keep a straight face.
