# Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling's "A Life in Pieces", BBC 1990.

On Hitler: <i><b>One could have had no inkling that he'd go onto blot his copybook in such a spectacular way.</b></i> (Episode 5).

This is a set of transcripts of the twelve 5 minute programmes, produced by Talkback and broadcast by the BBC during the Christmas period of 1990.

These are available on various YouTube accounts, some of which have been published there for a very long time, for example [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5918027E140EF1F7). Below you will find untimed individual episodes together with a link to the video.

Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling is a persona of Peter Cook, widely recognised as one the great comedic geniuses of the United Kingdom. Peter invented him while he was quite young, and from that period there is a famous sketch of a Sir Arthur talking about his vain efforts teaching crows to swim underwater. Trying to get animals to do things they're entirey unsuited for is a common trope of Sir Arthur's.

However there is some special about the elder Sir Arthur (Peter was only about 53 though) and besides the very sharp humour there is often also a poignancy to the futility of his activities.
